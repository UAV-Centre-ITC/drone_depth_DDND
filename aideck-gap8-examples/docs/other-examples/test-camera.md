## Testing the Himax camera on the AIdeck


This concerns the example in folder *AIdeck_examples/GAP8/test_functionalities/test_camera/*. This was tested on **GAP_SDK version 4.8.0.2**, which at the moment of writing was the newest we had a docker container for.

In the makefile enable `APP_CFLAGS += -DASYNC_CAPTURE` if you want to test the asynchronous camera capture and remove it if you want to test the normal one. To save a color image enable `APP_CFLAGS += -DCOLOR_IMAGE`. And, to capture a `324x324` image enable `APP_CFLAGS += -DQVGA_MODE`. *Please note though that capturing an image in non-QVGA mode might not always work correctly.*

To test out the code, first, source the AIdeck config (configs/ai_deck.sh) in your terminal and write

    make clean all run io=host

for directly running the code from L2 (second level internal memory) with your programmer.

## Run in Docker
To build and execute in the docker we need to place the `demosaicking`-files in the `common`-folder inside the docker.
```
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/module/data/ --device /dev/ttyUSB0 --privileged -P bitcraze/aideck:4.8.0.2 /bin/bash -c 'export GAPY_OPENOCD_CABLE=interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-tiny-h.cfg; source /gap_sdk/configs/ai_deck.sh; cd /module/data/;  make clean all run'
```
