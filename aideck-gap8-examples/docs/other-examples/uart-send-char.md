This concerns the example in the folder *AIdeck_examples/GAP8/test_functionalities/uart_send_char/*. This was tested on **GAP_SDK version 3.8.1**.


The uart send character example sends a character over UART1, meant to be read out by the Crazyflie at the other end. Make sure that the AI-deck driver is force compiled in the crazyflie firmware as explained [here](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/development/howto/#enabling-the-driver
).
