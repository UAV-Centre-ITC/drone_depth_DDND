This example streams JPEG or raw images from the GAP8 to the host where they are displayed and
colorized.

## Prerequisites

* Completed the [Getting started with the AI deck tutorial](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-aideck/)

## Setup the WiFi via the Crazyflie firmware
The WiFi on the aideck can be set up in a number of ways,
but to keep things simple for this tutorial we will be setting it up
via the Crazyflie firmware as an access point, which means you will be
connecting to the AI deck's WiFi to run the examples.

First see the [crazyflie-firmware repository documentation](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/building-and-flashing/build/) for more details on how to build and flash and checkout how to setup [kbuild's menuconfig](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/development/kbuild/).

Clone and configure the Crazyflie firmware by running the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware.git
$ cd crazyflie-firmware
$ make menuconfig
```
Note: for
Go to the menu *Expansion deck configuration* and make sure *Support AI deck*
is enabled. In the *Support AI deck* sub menu select *WiFi setup at startup* and the option *Act as Access Point*. Now go to the *Credentials for access-point*
menu and set the SSID and KEY as you wish.

Now it's time to flash the firmware. Build and flash over air with the following command, replacing [CRAZYFLIE_URI] with your crazyflie's URI with your own:

```
$ make
$ cfloader flash cf2.bin stm32-fw -w [CRAZYFLIE_URI]
```


## Configuration Wifi example

To select which mode (RAW or JPEG) change the code below in the ```wifi-img-streamer.c``` file.

```c
typedef enum
{
  RAW_ENCODING = 0,
  JPEG_ENCODING = 1
} __attribute__((packed)) StreamerMode_t;

static StreamerMode_t streamerMode = RAW_ENCODING;
```

## Building and flashing the example

To build and flash the example run the following:

```shell
$ cd aideck-gap8-examples
$ docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/module aideck-with-autotiler tools/build/make-example examples/other/wifi-img-streamer image
$ cfloader flash examples/other/wifi-img-streamer/BUILD/GAP8_V2/GCC_RISCV_FREERTOS/target.board.devices.flash.img deck-bcAI:gap8-fw -w radio://0/80/2M
```

**Note**: if you get `Unable to find image 'aideck-with-autotiler:latest' locally`, make sure that you have done [the getting started guide](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-aideck/) of the 'Setting up development environment' properly. Or replace it with the autotiler-less docker image bitcraze/aideck


## Starting the viewer

In order to start the viewer, you will need to the [python package of opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/?msclkid=d7172048cae011ecb4ebefc85fe0fc45). Do check [this issue](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/issues/611) if you also use the cfclient.

Install opencv python

```shell
$ pip install opencv-python
```

In order to view the images from the GAP8 connect to the WiFi access point on the deck and
run the following:

```shell
$ cd aideck-gap8-examples/examples/other/wifi-img-streamer
$ python opencv-viewer.py
```

Then you should be able to see the raw/color or jpeg image in the viewer like this:

![opencv viewer](/docs/images/viewer.png)

**Note**: If you like to save the images, you can run the opencv-viewer.py with the `--save` flag.

**Note**: If you enabled your aideck to connect to a wifi point, you would need to check the console tab of the CFclient to retrieve the ipaddress of the aideck. Then you will need to use the `-n` with the ip address with the viewer script.
